start.html
=========
Summary
---------
start.html is your customisable home and/or new-tab page.
The main aims of this project are that it is...
* ...aesthetically pleasing.
* ...that it allows for adding bookmarks without any knowledge of html (and therefore faster).
* ...and that it all runs from one file: start.html

I store my start.html page in my Dropbox folder and have it synced across all my browsers and computers.
